Building QjSimple under Mac OS X
(provided by Daniel-Constantin Mierla)

So, first I installed qgit from macports with brought me 
git4-mac tar ball and after 3 hours it got compiled and 
installed in /opt/local/lib and qgit worked file 
(after fixing it to compile, it was some include issue).

Then I got QTcreator via QT SDK for Mac OS X 
(http://www.qtsoftware.com/downloads) that installed 
again in /usr/lib the qt libs. Since I compiled with 
qt creator i think it uses those from /usr. I think the 
safest is to say QT4 libs for Mac OS X.

I am not yet familiar with the way mac packages itself. 
The applications are in a directory ending in .app and having 
a pretty standard structure. I saw some applications that 
include everything in this directory, libs, a.s.0. so 
practically are stand alone. I think qjsimple is not the case.
